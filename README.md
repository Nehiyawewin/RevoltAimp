# RevoltAimp
A simple python script using pyaimp to change status on Revolt.chat

# Why does this exist?
Uhhhhhhh

# Usage
Find your X-Session-Token. Open up revolt on your browser and open the developer panel to the network tab, then send a message. You should see a POST request, which will contain your token. (I dont know how to do this better but this works)

# Compiling
I compile this script into an exe. Use pyinstaller or auto-py-to-exe.
